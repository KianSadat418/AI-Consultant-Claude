# /founder -- Strategic Analysis Toolkit for Claude Code

**18 Skills** | **5 Parallel Agents** | **6 Scripts** | **MIT License**

A company-agnostic founder toolkit that delivers McKinsey-level strategic analysis directly inside Claude Code. Combines real-time data retrieval, parallel sub-agents, and structured synthesis to produce investor-ready deliverables in minutes instead of weeks.

Drop a `CONTEXT.md` file with your company details, run `/founder analyze`, and get a comprehensive strategic assessment across market sizing, competitive intelligence, GTM strategy, financial modeling, and legal structure. Swap the context file, re-run any command, get a fresh analysis for a different company.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KianSadat418/AI-Consultant-Claude/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Setup

```bash
# Copy the context template to your working directory
cp ~/.claude/templates/founder/CONTEXT-template.md ./CONTEXT.md

# Edit with your company details
# (the more detail you provide, the better the analysis)
```

### Run

```bash
# In Claude Code, type any command:
/founder              # See all available commands
/founder tam          # Market sizing analysis
/founder compete      # Competitive landscape
/founder analyze      # Full company audit (flagship)
```

## Architecture

The toolkit follows a 3-phase pipeline for every analysis:

### Phase 1: Data Retrieval
Every skill gathers real data before producing analysis. No skill generates output from training data alone.

- **Tier 1 (always)**: Claude Code built-in web search for current data points, market figures, competitor info, and recent news.
- **Tier 2 (when API keys available)**: Firecrawl for competitor website scraping, Perplexity API for deep market research, Crunchbase API for funding comparables.
- **Tier 3 (flagship only)**: Anthropic API parallel sub-agents for simultaneous multi-pillar analysis.

### Phase 2: Analysis
Each skill applies a specific named consulting framework (Porter's Five Forces, JTBD, MECE, BCG matrix, etc.) to the gathered data. The prompt engineering inside each SKILL.md is the core intellectual property of the package.

### Phase 3: Synthesis
For the flagship `/founder analyze` command, 5 parallel sub-agents (market, competitive, strategy, finance, legal) run simultaneously. Their outputs are collected and fed into a final synthesis call using `claude-opus-4-6` for the executive strategy document.

## CONTEXT.md Setup

The `CONTEXT.md` file is what makes this toolkit reusable across companies. It contains your company's essential information that every skill reads before running analysis.

```bash
cp ~/.claude/templates/founder/CONTEXT-template.md ./CONTEXT.md
```

**Required fields:**
- Company name, one-line description
- Stage (idea / pre-seed / seed / Series A+)
- Industry

**Recommended fields:**
- Website URL
- Target market and customer description
- Current traction (revenue, users, growth)
- Founding team summary
- Fundraising status and goals
- Known competitors
- Key risks and strategic questions

The more context you provide, the more tailored and accurate the analysis.

## API Keys

All API keys are optional. The toolkit works with zero configuration using Claude Code's built-in web search. API keys unlock enhanced data retrieval.

| Key | Required? | What It Unlocks | Cost |
|-----|-----------|----------------|------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Optional | Parallel sub-agents for `/founder analyze` | ~$0.10-0.40/run |
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | Optional | Competitor website scraping (pricing, features) | Free tier available |
| `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` | Optional | Deep market research with cited sources | Free tier available |
| `CRUNCHBASE_API_KEY` | Optional | Funding round comparables and investor data | Free tier available |

Set keys in your environment:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-key-here
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-key-here
export CRUNCHBASE_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## Cost Estimates

| Command | Without API | With Anthropic API |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Individual skills (`/founder tam`, etc.) | Free (uses Claude Code) | N/A |
| `/founder analyze` (sequential) | Free (uses Claude Code) | N/A |
| `/founder analyze` (parallel agents) | N/A | ~$0.10-0.40 per run |

The parallel agent path spawns 5 Sonnet calls + 1 Opus synthesis call per run.
